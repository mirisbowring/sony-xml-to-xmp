# Sony XML to XMP

I created this small script to convert the sony video sidecar files like `C0001M01.XML` to a `C0001.MP4.xmp` sidecarfile so that my [immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) instance is able to process the video metadata and show e.g. the locations the photo has been shot.

## Disclaimer

This is currently in `Works on my Machine` state. Currently i just want to upload my Sony a6500 photages without loosing infos.
